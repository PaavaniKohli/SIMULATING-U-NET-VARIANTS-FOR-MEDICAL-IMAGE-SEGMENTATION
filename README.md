# SIMULATING-U-NET-VARIANTS-FOR-MEDICAL-IMAGE-SEGMENTATION  OF COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA
Colorectal adenocarcinoma is a leading subtype of colorectal cancer, noted for its 
high prevalence and significant mortality rate worldwide. Accurate and early 
diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival, and histopathological image 
analysis plays a central role in this process. Manual examination of such images, 
however, is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. This project 
aims to automate the segmentation of colorectal adenocarcinoma in hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology images using advanced deep learning 
techniques. Multiple U-Net-based architectures are implemented and compared, 
including U-Net, Attention U-Net, Double U-Net, U-Net++, ResNet U-Net, Dense 
U-Net, and VGG U-Net. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as 
resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model generalization and 
performance.Each model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, 
Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index (IoU). Among the simulated models, ResNet 
U-Net and U-Net++ demonstrate superior performance in capturing structural 
details and preserving spatial context in segmented regions, making them strong 
candidates for clinical applications. These models effectively support the 
segmentation of cancerous tissues, showing notable improvements over traditional 
methods. The results validate the capability of deep learning, particularly U-Net 
variants, to facilitate efficient and reliable segmentation in medical imaging. This 
study contributes to the advancement of computer-aided diagnosis in digital 
pathology and provides a foundation for future research in ensemble modeling and 
clinical deployment. The proposed approach holds potential for improving the 
accuracy and efficiency of colorectal cancer diagnosis, ultimately aiding 
pathologists in making more informed decisions.
